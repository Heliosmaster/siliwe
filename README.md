## Siliwe
**Si**mple **Li**bra **We**bsite

This small and **very simple** Sinatra web application is aimed at providing basic functionality to the Android app [Libra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cachapa.libra) developed by [Daniel Cachapa](http://cachapa.net/).

###Features
* Authentication provided via [Google OAuth2 API](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) (as Siliwe is supposed to go alongside an android app, it's presumed one has a Google Account to use)
* Trend computation (similar to the Libra app) following the [Hacker's Diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/pencilpaper.html)
* Basic Graphs (thanks to [Drew Gallant](www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-gallant/13/35/953) for the help with the Google Chart APIs)

### This code sucks!
Yes, I am fully aware of it. This is my first dive, be gentle.

You are most definitely welcome to point out all the obvious errors, bad practices and all the other things that make you irk, either using GitHub issues or directly commenting the code. Also feel free to curse me, if that makes you feel better :)
